All native libraries that come with the Processing installation came from
[Processing Release 3.2.3](https://github.com/processing/processing/releases/tag/processing-0255-3.2.3). They were all copied from /modes/java/libraries/<component>/library to the native libs in this repo.

One notable exception are the native libraries that come with Video library for Processing (Gstreamer, LibGio); they were taken directly from the (https://github.com/processing/processing-video/commit/6c7e07bc612fc6d5f3e129841638a0573f46dc2a)[latest stable version at the moment].
